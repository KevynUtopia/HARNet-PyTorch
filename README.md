# HARNet-PyTorch  


<img src="https://github.com/KevynUtopia/HARNet-PyTorch/blob/main/Structure.jpg"/>  
Following the structure of HARNet, this repo contains the unofficial PyTorch implementation of HARNet on Dataset octa500. The dataset can be found [here](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/octa-500).
  
But the code here needs some preprocessing, please follow the code in `data_generator.ipynb` and `preproccessing.ipynb` for Gaussian Blur Operation, spliting and renaming the data into train and test set by 70% and 30%.
