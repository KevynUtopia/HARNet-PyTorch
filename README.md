# HARNet-PyTorch  
<img src="https://github.com/KevynUtopia/HARNet-PyTorch/blob/main/Structure.jpg" align="middle"/>  
Following the structure of HARNet, this repo contains the PyTorch implementation of HARNet on Dataset octa500. The official release of dataset can be found [here](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/octa-500) .  [知乎](http://www.zhihu.com)
  
But the code here needs some preprocessing, please follow the code in `data_generator.ipynb` and `preproccessing.ipynb` to do the Gaussian Blur Operation, split and rename the data into train and test set by 70% and 30%.
